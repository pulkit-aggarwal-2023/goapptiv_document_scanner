## Usage/Examples

### iOS

iOS 13.0 or higher is needed to use the plugin. Change the minimum platform version to 13 (or higher) in your `ios/Podfile` file.

iOS 13.0 or higher is needed to use the plugin. If compiling for any version lower than 13.0 make sure to check the iOS version before using the plugin. Change the minimum platform version to 13 (or higher) in your `ios/Podfile` file, and inform/request access to the permissions acording with `permission_handler`

```podspec
post_install do |installer|
  installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
    flutter_additional_ios_build_settings(target)
    target.build_configurations.each do |config|
      config.build_settings['GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS'] ||= [
        '$(inherited)',

        ## dart: PermissionGroup.camera
         'PERMISSION_CAMERA=1',

        ## dart: PermissionGroup.photos
         'PERMISSION_PHOTOS=1',
      ]

    end
    # End of the permission_handler configuration
  end
end
```

## Fix build on xCode 15

Add this line to your Podfile in your project:

```
pod 'WeScan', :path => '.symlinks/plugins/edge_detection/ios/WeScan-3.0.0'
```

=> like this below:

```podspec
target 'Runner' do
  use_frameworks!
  use_modular_headers!
  pod 'WeScan', :path => '.symlinks/plugins/edge_detection/ios/WeScan-3.0.0'
  flutter_install_all_ios_pods File.dirname(File.realpath(__FILE__))
end
```

Add below permission to the `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

- one with the key `Privacy - Camera Usage Description` and a usage description.

Or in text format add the key:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>Can I use the camera please?</string>
```
